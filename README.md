### Analysis of products and customer profiles to direct advertising
This project was part of my data analytics course with Career Foundry. In this project I used the data from Instacart to try to gain some insights as where to best direct advertising.
The scripts comprise of questions set out for the project and my methods of solving them.

The were 5 datasets provided including sperate data for customers, products and orders for example. These needed to be analysed and merged as appropriate.
